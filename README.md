# PuzzlePlatforms

Small little fps game that I messed around with a couple years ago in Unreal engine. Puzzle Platforms is a multiplayer fps game that involves parkour and fun little zelda like puzzles. You can find it on https://the-pickle.itch.io/puzzle-platforms. (I mainly use Unity now instead of Unreal and I will most likely not update this game anytime sooon)
